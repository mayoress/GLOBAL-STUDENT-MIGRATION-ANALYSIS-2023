Recommendations and Observations
For Students: Prioritize regions with higher scholarship access and post-graduation placement opportunities.
For Institutions: Strengthen career support systems for international students.
For Policymakers: Streamline visa pathways and encourage global academic exchange through partnership programs.
Improve Placement Data Tracking
A large portion of students (2,491) have N/A placement company. Strengthen data collection from alumni and partner universities to better track employment outcomes.
Build stronger partnerships with top recruiters (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple) to increase placement opportunities.
5. Scholarship Effectiveness Analysis

Conduct a comparative study of students with vs. without scholarships to see how it impacts their salary and placement.
Use these findings to design better scholarship-targeting strategies (e.g., prioritize fields with low placement but high potential, like Arts or Medicine).
6 . Enhance Language Training Programs

Many students take IELTS/Duolingo, but a significant number take no test. Universities should provide language prep programs to boost employability abroad.
Track whether higher language test scores lead to higher salaries and prioritize test coaching for target countries like UK, Germany, and Russia.
7. Visa Strategy Optimization

Since Schengen Student Visa is the most common, create tailored guidance for students heading to Europeâ€”especially regarding post-study work visas.
Compare salary/placement outcomes across visa types to advise students on which destination offers the best ROI.
Conclusion
This analysis underscores that education mobility goes beyond classrooms â€” itâ€™s a data-driven reflection of ambition, opportunity, and global connectivity.
As trends continue evolving, data analytics remains essential to understanding how education shapes economies and individuals alike.
